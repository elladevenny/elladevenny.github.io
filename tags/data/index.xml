      <description>Some claim the 1995 Huskers are the best team in college football history. After the LSU Tigers won the 2019 national championship, many compared them to the infamous Huskers team, and some even claim that they are now the best team in college history.
I was intrigued by this, given that the teams were in two different decades I wanted to dive deeper into the stats and come to the bottom of this discussion.</description>

      <description>A lot of college football fans, particularly those that support a team in the SEC conference, claim that the SEC is the best conference in college football. The SEC conference is packed with a lot of talent and are always strongly represented in rankings like the AP Top 25 Poll.
If we dive into data focused on NFL players from the 2020-2021 season, is the SEC really dominant when it comes to NFL player production?</description>
